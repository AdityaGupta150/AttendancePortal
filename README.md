For the DevHack1.0 team -
1. Install python, and Git-Scm (search on net, at install just go clicking OK) on you computer
2. Run 'pip install bs4 requests html_table_parser flask flask-sqlalchemy'

Actual - To simply deploy it to your localhost, first install all packages given in requirements.txt using pip. Then, run 'python Table_app.py' Now, just open 'localhost:5000' in your browser

Note - 1. It's better to use a virtual environment, create it using virtualenv (Search on net)
2. The port number maybe different, if you have specified the port number, at the app.run() line in the code, though default is port:5000
